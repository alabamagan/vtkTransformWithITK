# vtkTransformWithITK

This is a learning project I do to familarize with class template, itk and vtk. The executable compiled from this project will read vtk polydata file and an itk transform .txt file and carry out a inverse transform (of the itk .txt file) on the vtk polydata.
[Note] You must include both .cpp and .h file in order to compile this library.
